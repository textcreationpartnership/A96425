            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>An Examination and Confutation of <hi>Tho. More,</hi> his treatiſe of the univerſality of Gods free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace in Chriſt to mankinde.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat there was valew and worth enough in Chriſts death, (in regard of that ſufficiency and excellency of the price) for the redeeming of all the men in the world, is granted on all hands: But whether Chriſt in Gods intention and his owne performance, ſo paid a ranſome for all and every particular man, as therby to make ſatisfaction, and procure reconciliation with God for them, is the thing in queſtion. This <hi>T. M.</hi> undertakes to prove, and for proofe of this makes uſe of theſe three things which he makes the principall grounds of his doctrine.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of a diſtinction. of that reconciliation which Chriſt hath wrought in his body with God for men, and that which he makes by his ſpirit in men. The firſt of which he will have to be common to all: the ſecond peculiar onely to ſome.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of a diſtinction betwixt a common and ſpeciall ſalvation, which Chriſt hath purchaſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Of the generall expreſſions which the Scripture uſeth in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth Chriſts death, as that he dyed <hi>for all, for every man, for the world,</hi> and ſuch like, let us examine how well theſe will hold.</p>
               <p>That his diſtinction of a reconciliation which Chriſt hath effected in his body with God for men, (that is for all men) and which he ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth by his ſpirit in men to God (that is ſome men onely, as he underſtands it, <hi>pag.</hi> 4.5. and in his whole diſcourſe) is not agreeable to Scripture, may thus appeare.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>if we be reconciled to God by the death of his ſonne, much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life,</hi> Rom. 5.10. Reconciliation is here made the greateſt worke, if the greateſt work be done, much more ſhall the leſſer. <hi>If God hath given his Son, together with him, he will give all things alſo.</hi> Rom. 8.32. But he doth not give all things to all, therefore not his ſonne.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:120043:3"/>
               <p n="2">2. Reconciliation with God and forgiveneſſe of ſinne, are made unſeparable companions. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and not imputing their treſpaſſes.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19. <hi>In whom we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption through his bloud, the forgiveneſſe of ſinne.</hi> Eph. 1.7. But ſome men ſhall have their treſpaſſes imputed to them, all men ſhall not have their ſinnes forgiven, therefore all men are not reconciled, all are not redeemed. Neither can this be underſtood of reconciling, in regard of originall ſinne onely, for the word which the Apoſtle u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which ſignifieth all kind of treſpaſſes or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſts death and interceſſion are of equall extent. <hi>It is Chriſt that dyed, or rather that is riſen againe, and is at the right hand of God, and maketh interceſſion for us;</hi> Rom. 8.34. <hi>We have an advocate with the father even Chriſt the juſt, who is the propitiation for our ſinnes,</hi> 1 John 2.1.2. The latter, as <hi>Beza</hi> obſerves, is made the ground of the former, why is Chriſt our advocate, becauſe he hath made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation or reconciliation for us: but he makes not interceſſion for all, he is not an advocate for all, therefore, he hath not dyed for all, he hath not reconciled all.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If he hath dyed for all, then he was made ſinne for all, then all ſhall be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him, for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>he which knew no ſinne was made ſinne for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. But all are not made the righteouſneſſe of God in him, therefore he was not made ſinne for all, he dyed not for all.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If he hath reconciled us in his body, then we ſhall be certainly reconciled by his ſpirit: for by his ſufferings in the body, he hath purchaſed his ſpirit for us, and what he hath purchaſed we ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have; <hi>all things that pertaine to life and godlineſſe are given to us in and through him.</hi> 2 Pet. 1.3. Amongſt which, his ſpirit is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall part.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If Chriſt ſhould purchaſe reconciliation for us, and not apply this to us, then he were an imperfect Saviour; halfe a ſaviour (for he knowes we are not able to apply this to our ſelves, and while it be applyed we are never the better for it,) but he is a whole and perfect Saviour, he delivers <hi>men from the power of all their enemies;</hi> therefore from the power of unbeliefe; which cannot be, but by giving them the ſpirit of faith. What the better to hold forth never ſo ſoveraigne
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:120043:3"/>a potion to a dying man, who is ſo far ſpent as hee is not able to reach forth the leaſt finger to take it; Chriſt is both a skilfull and carefull Phyſitian; therefore, where he undertakes the cure, will be wanting in nothing, which may effect it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If Chriſt intended to reconcile all men to God by the things which he ſuffered in his body, or by the reconciliation wrought in his body with God for men, (which are <hi>Tho. More</hi> his own words) why doth he not alſo reconcile them by his Spirit? why doth hee not ſend his Spirit to worke this reconciliation in them by application of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? will not the ſame love of Chriſt which moved him to lay down his life for them, move him alſo to give his Spirit to them? were not all things that belong to our ſalvation and perfect deliverance, a part of that purchaſe which Chriſt hath made; doth not this purchaſe depend upon the perfect price which he hath paid? if he hath paid the ſame price (namely his owne precious bloud) for all; why doe not all receive the thing which he hath purchaſed? If it be ſaid that ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it when it is offered: It may readily be anſwered, that ſo doe all; till Chriſt by his Spirit makes them willing and able to take it: and if this Spirit be purchaſed for all, (as it muſt be if the ſame price be paid for all) why doth he not give it to all? The Apoſtle joynes theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as effects depending one on another. <hi>God ſent his Son to redeem thoſe that were under the Law that we might receive the adoption of ſonnes, and becauſe ye are ſons, he hath ſent the ſpirit of his Sonne into your hearts, Gal.</hi> 4.5.6. So that both Adoption, and the ſpirit of Adoption are made to flow from Redemption as the proper effects of it: and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is the proper effect of Chriſts death. Beſides he ſaith, that if <hi>any man hath not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of Chriſts, Rom.</hi> 8.9. If Chriſt hath bought us with the price of his bloud, <hi>we are not our own but his,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. laſt, if we be his, he will give us his Spirit, firſt or laſt, for if any man hath not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of Chriſts.</p>

More</hi> brings for ſtabliſhing his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of univerſall grace, is a diſtinction betwixt a common ſalvation which Chriſt hath purchaſed for all, and a ſpeciall ſalvation which he hath purchaſed for beleevers. For anſwer unto which, it will not be denied that all ſorts of men have many common benefits by Chriſts comming into the World, and by the Redemption which he hath purchaſed. But that he hath purchaſed a common Salvation for all; if Salvation be taken in a ſpirituall ſenſe, namely for eternall life, or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:120043:4"/>ſomething which belongs to it; (in which ſenſe) it is alway taken in the New Teſtament) doth no where appear in Scripture.</p>

                  </label> This cannot be ſo underſtood.</p>
               <p>For, 1. The Apoſtle would never have given ſuch diligence, and thought it ſo needfull to write to them of ſuch a Salvation as was common with them, to others who were damned; having in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going verſe directed his ſpeech to ſuch as were <hi>called and ſanctified of God the Father reſerved unto Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and prayed for <hi>mercy and peace</hi> (which are effects of ſpeciall love) in their behalf he would never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend ſo low in the very next words as to commend ſo earneſtly to them a ſalvation which was common to thoſe that were loſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Salvation mentioned in the beginning of the verſe is of no larger extent then the Faith mentioned in the end. Which whether it be underſtood of the grace of Faith, or of the doctrine of Faith, (as it is uſually taken by Interpreters) yet it is a gift or priviledge peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly belonging to the Saints, it <hi>was once given to the Saints,</hi> not to all; ſo that the common ſalvation here ſpoken of, is the ſalvation which was common to them, together with the Apoſtle, yea, with all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers.</p>

               <p n="1">1. That the effect of Chriſts death was only a poſſible or potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and not an actuall ſalvation, which agrees not with the Scripture expreſsion. For it is ſaid, he came into the world to ſave ſinners, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. not to purchaſe a poſſibility of ſalvation, to redeem thoſe that were under the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.5. not to purchaſe a poſſibility of Redemption, to take away the ſins of the World, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.29. to ſave his people from their ſins, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21. which implies more then a poſſibility of theſe things.</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:120043:5"/>
               <p n="2">2. How could Chriſt by his death make them ſaveable who were already loſt, purchaſe a poſſibility of ſalvation for them who were already damned? (as millions of men were before his comming) <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferni nulla redemptio:</hi> there is no comming out of Hell. There is a great Gulph ſet (ſaith <hi>Abraham</hi>) to the rich man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.26. ſo that none can come from them to us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This poſſibility of ſalvation muſt have reference to man or to God: If to man, ſo that there is now a poſſibility purchaſed for man to ſave himſelfe by comming to Chriſt if he will; this cannot hold, for no man can <hi>come to Chriſt unleſſe the Father draw him. Ioh.</hi> 6.44. If it hath reference to God, ſo that Chriſt by his death hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a poſſibility for God to ſave men: this doth much extenuate the infinite excellency and vertue of Chriſts death, and make the work of mans ſalvation to be thereby very little advanced and ſet forward: It being poſsible for God (even before Chriſt was given to die) to ſave men, by what way and means himſelf ſhould think beſt; and Chriſt by his death hath purchaſed no actuall, but a potentiall ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namely apoſsibility for God to ſave whom he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the effect of Chriſts death be only a poſsible or potentiall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, how comes it to bee made actuall? If it be ſaid by mans beleeving and applying it by faith: it may be replyed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Faith can apply no other ſalvation then what is purchaſed, (for our application changeth not the nature of the thing) How then can man be actually redeemed and ſaved, by a redemption and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is only potentiall or poſsible?</p>
               <p n="2">2. If man by his application doth make it of potentiall to become actuall, then mans work ſhould be more perfect then Chriſts worke, (for an actuall redemption or ſalvation, is a more perfect worke then a potentiall only.)</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid that Chriſt works this alſo by putting a ſpirit of faith into men: this confirms what we have ſaid before, namely that Chriſt hath purchaſed not only a potentiall, but actuall ſalvation for men, Therefore by his death hath purchaſed not only ſalvation, but all that belongs to it, namely that ſpirit, which works faith and all other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces needfull to ſalvation, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>hee hath bleſſed us with all ſpirituall bleſſings in Chriſt, Epheſ.</hi> 1.3. and ſo is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Redeemer, both by making ſatisfaction to God for us, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king application of that ſatisfaction to us, by his Spirit.</p>

Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular man amongſt the Corinthians did not make rents and ſchiſmes in the Church, neither did every man come unworthily to the Sacrament; but a great many did, and therefore this expreſſion of generality is uſed: and ſo when the Apoſtle ſayth, that <hi>Chriſt taſted death for every man;</hi> it doth not neceſſarily follow, that he dyed for every particular man, but for many: he gave <hi>himſelfe a ranſome for many, Mat.</hi> 20.28. even for every of the ſonnes of God, for every heire of ſalvation, of whoſe ſalvation Chriſt is appointed to be the head and Captaine, for ſo it followes in the next verſe.

               <p n="3">3.

This cannot be underſtood of the whole world as including every particular man, but onely of the worſt part of the Whole wicked world. And as the word <hi>World</hi> is ofttimes taken for the worſt, ſo ſometimes for the better part of the world: as when it is ſaid, that <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the World to himſelfe and not imputing their ſinnes,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19. There is a great part of the world who were never reconciled, but alwayes have and alwayes ſhall remayne in a ſtate of enmity with God and Chriſt; even all thoſe to whom Chriſt ſhall ſay at the laſt day, <hi>I never knew you,</hi> Mat. 7.25. all thoſe who before Chriſts comming had been <hi>ſtrangers from the covenant, and had lived without God in the World,</hi> Eph. 2.12. A great part of the world ſhall have their ſinnes imputed to them, for Chriſt <hi>ſhall ſet them on his left hand, and ſay unto them, go yee curſed into hell fire, Mat.</hi> 25. ſo alſo is the world taken when Chriſt ſayth, <hi>he came into the World not to condemne the World, but that the World might be ſaved by him,</hi> Joh. 3.17. This cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the whole world, for Chriſt ſhall condemne a great part of the world, even all thoſe that he ſhall ſet on his left hand, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:120043:7"/>what ever he ſhall do at laſt, he intended at firſt to do. Neither ſhall all the world be ſaved by him, neither did he intend to ſave all, for then he ſhould miſſe of his intention; neither in reaſon can we thinke that he came to ſave ſuch as were already damned: therefore by world, muſt needs be underſtood the better part, namely, ſo many as are ſaved. So Chriſt is ſayd to be <hi>the bread of God that came down from heaven, and giveth life to the world,</hi> Joh. 6.33. There is a world to whom Chriſt actually giveth life, but he doth not this to the whole world, but onely to the believing world; for he <hi>that believeth not, ſhall not ſee life.</hi> Joh. 3. <hi>laſt. he is condemned already.</hi>

Now the ſame perſons cannot be the objects of the greateſt love and greateſt hatred, for then there ſhould be no difference betwixt the elect and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; by all which it appeares that there is no neceſſity thoſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall expreſſions uſed in Scripture touching Chriſts death ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a generall ſenſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It appeares plainely by many other places of Scripture, that theſe expreſſions of Chriſt dying for all men loving the world, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himſelfe to be a propitiation for the ſinnes of the whole world, 1 Joh. 2.2. If they be truly underſtood, muſt be underſtood in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained ſenſe; namely, for the believing world, for the world not onely of Jews but of Gentiles, that ſhall be ſaved (In which ſenſe this place of <hi>John</hi> is to be taken) He is a <hi>propitiation not onely for our ſinnes</hi> (Saith ſaint <hi>John,</hi> a Jew, writing to the Jewes) but <hi>for the ſinnes of the whole world,</hi> of the world of believing Gentiles, as well as of our ſelves. Now that this and other like places, where generalities in the like kinde are uſed, muſt neceſſarily be taken in a limited and reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſenſe doth plainly, as I ſaid, appeare by many other places of Scripture, as when it is ſayd, that <hi>Chriſt laid down his life for his ſheep,</hi> Joh. 10.15. <hi>for his people,</hi> Mat. 1.21. <hi>for the ſons of God,</hi> Joh. 11.52. <hi>for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:120043:8"/>the elect of God,</hi> Rom. 8.33, 34. <hi>that the promiſe of Chriſt is given to them that beleeve,</hi> Gal. 3.22. that Chriſt <hi>hath loved his Church, and given himſelfe for it,</hi> Eph. 5.25. Now all are not the ſheep of Chriſt, the people of God, the ſonnes of God, the elect, the Church of God, for then there ſhould be no difference betwixt theſe and the world, from which the Scripture diſtinguiſheth them. Beſides, Chriſt ſayth, that he <hi>prayed not for the world, but for thoſe whom the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had given him,</hi> Joh. 17.9. Thoſe whom Chriſt dyed for, he would not refuſe to pray for: that for <hi>theſe he ſanctified himſelfe,</hi> ver. 19. that is, ſet himſelfe apart to be made an offering for ſinne, The Saints ſing a new ſong to the lambe, becauſe he <hi>had redeemed them out of every tongue, kinred, people, And</hi> Rev. 6.9. Therefore he hath not redeemed all of every kinred, people and nation. All thoſe whom Chriſt dyed for, he loved, and whom <hi>he loveth, he waſheth with his bloud,</hi> Rev. 1.5. but all are not waſhed. <hi>That bloud of Chriſt, which through the eternall ſpirit he offered unto God, purgeth their conſciences from dead workes</hi> for whom it is offered, Heb. 9.14. but all have not their conſciences purged, <hi>By the offering of the body of Jeſus Chriſt once made, all are ſanctified for whom it is offered,</hi> cap. 10.10. <hi>He hath given himſelfe for his Church to ſanctifie it,</hi> Eph. 5.25. but all are not ſanctified. Therefore theſe generall expreſſions before mentioned, cannot be underſtood generally of all and every particular man, but muſt of neceſſity be limited and appropriated to ſuch as theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures ſpeake of.</p>
               <p>Tuhs we ſee, that the chiefe grounds which <hi>T.

Is not unbeliefe a fruit of the fleſh, a branch of the old man, &amp; a principall member of the great body of ſinne? and was not Chriſt crucified that our old man might be crucified, and the body of ſinne might bee deſtroyed? <hi>Romans</hi> 16.6.</p>

               <p>If it be ſaid that the ſinner ſuffers himſelf, becauſe he will not apply Chriſts ſuffering and ſatisfaction; to this it may be anſwered, that if Chriſt loved him ſo far as to ſuffer and make ſatisfaction for him; he will take order that application ſhall be made, for Chriſt is a perfect Saviour, and will not ſuffer the fruit of his ſuffering to be loſt; nor have the effect of them to mans arbitrement.</p>

                  </label> For anſwer, here we may take notice that <hi>Tho. More</hi> grants that the word <hi>(World)</hi> may ſometime be taken for the better part, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Elect; at leaſt for a part of them which elſewhere he ſeemes not willing to grant; but that the World cannot bee ſo taken here, appears.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe our Saviour here oppoſeth the World to thoſe whom the Father had given him out of the World; now thoſe whom the Father had given, were all Elect, as appears, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. all <hi>thoſe to whom he ſhould give eternall life:</hi> Therefore he doth not oppoſe the Elect to the Elect, one part of the Elect to another, but all the Elect to the wicked World, for which he would not pray.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The manifeſtation of his Name, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. is the ſame with effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall calling, and giving of ſome to him by the Father, is made the ground and cauſe of this manifeſtation, and ſo in order of nature goes before it. Hence our Saviour ſaith, that <hi>he manifeſteth himſelfe to thoſe whom the Father hath given him;</hi> when had he given them? namely before he manifeſted himſelf to them; (for the word is in the <hi>praeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect tenſe,</hi> and ſpeaks of a thing already paſt and done) beſides, in the words following he ſhews plainly the ſame thing; <hi>Thine they were</hi> (ſaith he) and <hi>thou gaveſt them me.</hi> How were they Gods, but by Election, and by Election he gave them to his Sonne, <hi>appointing them to obtaine ſalvation by Ieſus Chriſt?</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.9. So that giving here, is not effectuall calling, but that which goes before it, as the ground and cauſe of it, namely Election; according to that of the Apoſtle; whom he hath predeſtinated, thoſe alſo he hath called, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our Saviour mentions this praying as a choice priviledge belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to the Elect; and as to the Elect only, ſo to all the Elect ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:120043:12"/>in oppoſition to the wicked World: from which therfore none of the Elect are to be excluded; for he prayes for all thoſe whom the Father had given him both called and uncalled. I pray not onely for theſe, but for thoſe who ſhall believe in me, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.28.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thoſe uncalled ones whom our Saviour prayes for, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. he diſtinguiſheth from the World, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. &amp; 23. and therefore it is not likely he would expreſſe them by the name of the world in <hi>ver.</hi> 9. And this which hath been ſaid may likewiſe anſwer the two laſt objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for if the World here cannot ſignifie the Elect uncalled, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the wicked World, then Chriſt doth not pray for them at another time, or in another manner then for his own; for he doth not pray for them at all.</p>
               <p>So that the Argument ſtill holds good, if Chriſt would not pray for wicked men, ſuch as ſhall periſh in the end; hee would not die for them, for to lay downe his life was an action of the greateſt love; and for whom he hath done the greater, he will alſo do the leſſe: His love in dying, and thereby making ſatisfaction being the foundation of his interceſſion, and all other benefits belonging to our Redemption.</p>

               <p n="2">2. That there is ſuch a neceſſary connexion betwixt election and redemption, may thus be proved.</p>
               <p>All thoſe, and onely thoſe who are elected, are likewiſe redeemed, called, juſtified, glorified.</p>
               <p>But all are not elected, nor ſhall be called, juſtified, glorified, therefore all are not redeemed.</p>
               <p>The propoſition is proved by thoſe Scriptures which make the love of election, to be the ground and cauſe of redemption and all the reſt. <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his onely begotten ſon;</hi> which cannot be meant of a common love, becauſe it tends <hi>to everlaſting life,</hi> Joh. 3.16. <hi>to ſalvation,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.16. <hi>we love him becauſe he loved us firſt, and gave himſelfe to be a propitiation for our ſins,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.10, <hi>God ſetteth out his love in that while we were ſinners, he gave Chriſt to dye for us,</hi> Rom. 5.8. ſo that Gods love is the cauſe of giving his ſon, where that goes before, this muſt needs follow, neither is this ever to be found, where that hath not gone before. To this purpoſe alſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſayth, <hi>we are choſen in him,</hi> Eph. 1.4. (not as the foundation of our election which is onely from the good pleaſure of his will, ver. 5.) but of our redemption and ſalvation, in that <hi>he hath appointed us to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.9. In both which places Chriſt is made the fruit and effect of election, therefore of equall extent with it, reaching neither ſhorter nor farther then that doth, ſo that he is given for all, and onely thoſe that are appointed to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For if God therefore gives Chriſt for men, becauſe he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them to ſalvation, it follows on the other ſide, that if he hath not appointed all men to ſalvation, he hath not given Chriſt for all, and how can we in reaſon thinke, that God ſhould give his ſonne to purchaſe ſalvation, for thoſe whom he never intended to ſave; yea, more, for ſuch whom he intended to deſtroy. For it cannot be denyed that God will bring deſtruction upon a great part of men; and what he doth in time, he intended to do before all time.</p>

               <p n="1">1. An Antecedent will, and a conſequent will, both which they make to agree properly unto God; and yet by one of theſe, he wills the ſalvation of all, by the other, the damnation of ſome.</p>

               <p n="3">3. A conditionall and an abſolute or peremptory decree, touching the ſame perſons, one ſucceeding the other; as that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhall be ſaved if he doth believe, and when he doth believe, that he ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be ſaved.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And for the order they make the decree of giving Chriſt, to go before any decree of mans ſalvation; and the decree of ſaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, to go before the ſaving of any particular perſons: that theſe things cannot ſtand nor agree with the Scriptures, nor the excellent nature of God, appears by theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p>To begin firſt with the order. How can God be ſayd to decree the giving of Chriſt, before he had any intention or determination
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:120043:17"/>of mans ſalvation; when as the end why he gave Chriſt, is this, <hi>that he might ſave ſinners,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.15. and this was the reaſon of the name given him by the Angel, you <hi>ſhall call his name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave my people from their ſinnes,</hi> Mat. 1.21. Looke for what end Chriſt came into the world, for that end God ſent him, and for that end he appointed to ſend him, but he came to ſave ſinners: how then can the determination of giving Chriſt, go before the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of mans ſalvation? beſides, our Saviour makes the love of God to be the ground of giving his ſonne: <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his ſonne,</hi> John 3.16. Now this is ſuch a love as tends to ſalvation, therefore the intention of ſalvation cannot follow the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of giving Chriſt; for though mans ſalvation be not the laſt end of giving Chriſt, yet it is ſuch as can never be ſevered from the laſt, the greateſt glory of God appearing in that ſalvation of man, which is purchaſed by Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How can the ſalvation of believers be decreed, before the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of particular perſons? becauſe then the object of Gods decree muſt be, not perſons but qualities; not the men but their faith, acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents without a ſubject: but there is no touch in Scripture tending this way, for the Apoſtle tels the <hi>Epheſians</hi> that God had choſen not their faith but them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. and the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> that he had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to obtaine ſalvation, 1 <hi>Theſſa.</hi> 5.9. not their faith, and that he loved <hi>Jacob</hi> and hated <hi>Eſau</hi> before they were borne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. not the ones cleaving to the righteouſneſſe of faith, and the others follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the righteouſneſſe of the law, but themſelves; ſo every where perſons, not things, are named upon the like occaſions. Neither can it ſtand with reaſon, for that cannot be the object of Gods decree, which neither hath, nor never ſhall have being, qualities never have any being but in their ſubjects, faith conſidered by it ſelfe, abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from his ſubject, never had nor ſhall have being: neither have believers any being, but in <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> and other particular belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving perſons. It is a true rule in Logicke, that <hi>univerſalia non exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant niſi in ſingularibus:</hi> Humanity hath no being but in <hi>Socrates, Plato,</hi> and other individuall perſon; ſo neither believing nor belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers have any exiſtence or being, but in the particular individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all perſons of faithfull <hi>Abraham, Moſes,</hi> and other the like.</p>
               <p>And the decree of ſaving believers, is nothing elſe but a decree of beſtowing ſalvation upon <hi>Abraham</hi> or other-like faithfull perſon,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:120043:18"/>when he is a believer; where ſalvation hath reference to the decree and believing to the execution: and it is no more but this, that God decrees to bring <hi>Abraham</hi> to Salvation by faith, and to beſtow this Salvation upon him when he is a believer; and in Gods decree <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> perſon plainly goes before his Faith, going in this order, I decree to ſave <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that he may be ſaved I decree to give him faith, without which he can never come to enjoy Salvation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the decrees themſelves, a conditionall decree is ſuch as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree to God, for thus it runs; I decree to ſave <hi>Peter</hi> if he will believe; which either muſt beare this ſenſe that God will ſave <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> being a believer, and then it is all one with the abſolute decree whereby he hath decreed to bring <hi>Peter</hi> to ſalvation by believing: or elſe God decrees <hi>Peters</hi> ſalvation upon condition of his faith, ſo as if afterwards <hi>Peter</hi> ſhall come a believer, then he will abſolutely decree to ſave him; if otherwiſe he will abſolutely decree to damne him: now in this ſenſe it cannot agree to God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For firſt, in this conditionall decree of Salvation, God puts no difference betwixt <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Peter;</hi> betwixt ſuch as come to enjoy Salvation in heaven, and ſuch as come to be damned in hell; for he decrees likewiſe to ſave <hi>Iudas</hi> as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> if <hi>Iudas</hi> will believe, and to damne <hi>Peter</hi> as well as <hi>Iudas,</hi> if <hi>Peter</hi> will not: by this decree <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> are loved and hated both alike.</p>
               <p>And what a decree of Salvation may we thinke this to be that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Reprobate as well as to the Elect; to the damned in hell, as to the Saints in heaven? by this it is all one to be loved or hated, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, or rejected. How then can Election be an act of greateſt love?</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is no certainty in this decree, for it hath no certain object; damnation being the object of this decree as well as ſalvation, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the one equally with the other: now both theſe cannot be certain, becauſe they cannot both ſtand together, the one being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the other; ſo that if Salvation be certaine, damnation is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, and ſo on the contrary.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is true, that God decrees conditions, but theſe conditions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the execution, not to the decree: God decrees to bring men to Salvation by the conditions of faith, repentance, and the like: theſe are therefore neceſſary for effecting Salvation, but not for eſtabliſhing the decree to Salvation; theſe muſt go before mans Salvation, but
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:120043:18"/>not before Gods decree. All conditions are as means fitting for the end; and means have the nature of a cauſe, and are all one with it: food is the means of nouriſhment, and ſo the cauſe of it; ſo Phyſick is the means and cauſe of health: thus it is with Faith and Repentance, they are means, and ſo cauſes of Salvation; though not meritorious, yet preparing and diſpoſing cauſes, though not cauſes why God gives it, yet cauſes fitting us to receive what he freely gives: if therefore theſe ſhould neceſſarily belong not only to Salvation, but to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree whereby we are appointed to Salvation; then the decree ſhould have cauſes as well as the execution of it: which were it ſo, how can Gods will and decree be the firſt and higheſt cauſe of all other things?</p>
               <p n="4">4. God when he decrees life to believers, or to <hi>Peter</hi> if he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, knows certainly that he will believe: and therefore his decree is not conditionall, but abſolute. If a man determines to take a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to morrow if it be faire weather, and knows certainly at the ſame time that it will bee faire weather; this is an abſolute determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

                  </label> God hath decreed to execute his purpoſe of Salvation by meanes, and theſe are conditions of Salvation, as Faith, Repentance, and the like: theſe therefore muſt be made known to men, becauſe no man can come to Salvation without them; God having decreed the means as well as the end: but though theſe go before Salvation, and are the cauſes of that, they follow the decree and are effects of that: for Gods decree is the firſt cauſe of Salvation and all that belongs to it: the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant miſtaking, or wilfull jumbling together of theſe two, namely the decree and execution, is the cauſe of much confuſion in mens thoughts, touching the nature and order of Gods decrees. Hence it comes to paſſe that becauſe the Scripture propounds certaine condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:120043:19"/>as neceſſary to mans Salvation; ſome take occaſion to inferre a neceſſity of theſe unto Gods decree touching mans Salvation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as theſe belong only to the execution, not to the decree; and therfore cannot be brought into that: A man cannot build an houſe without Timber and Stone, cannot he therfore purpoſe the having of a fit ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation for himſelf; unleſſe the conſideration of Timber and Stone firſt come into his mind?</p>
               <p n="4">4. If God decrees to give men Salvation conditionally, yet how doth he decree to give men faith conditionally? He gives to all men ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely the power of believing (as <hi>Arminians</hi> teach) but upon what condition doth he give the act of believing? if it be ſaid upon this condition, namely, if they do not reſiſt Gods call; he decrees to give them the act of believing, and ſo actuall faith: But not to reſiſt, is to obey, and to obey God calling to believe, is to believe. So then by this doctrine God ſhould decree to give men faith, if they have faith; and to make them believe, if they do it already: for upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of obeying his call to believe, that is, of their believing, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth to beſtow faith upon them: and this is the happy iſſue of the conditionall decree, he decrees to give men faith if they have it alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Antecedent and conſequent wills are ſuch as cannot agree to God as they underſtand them. For his antecedent will they make to be ſuch wherby he wills and earneſtly deſires the ſalvation of all men: the conſequent will, that wherby he wills the damnation of ſome, namely ſuch as perſiſt in unbelief; and the ſalvation of others; namely ſuch as perſevere in the faith; now theſe cannot agree with the nature of God; for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. For this antecedent will hath ſometimes an end, and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent will alway a beginning; the abſolute or peremptory decree of damnation, never taking place till the antecedent or conditionall will touching ſalvation be expired: and ſo likewiſe the peremptory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of ſalvation, not taking place till the ceaſing of the other. Now the acts of Gods will are immanent acts, therfore eternall like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

                  </label> Then upon this foreſight, he only purpoſeth to will their ſalvation when they do believe and perſevere; but he doth not actually will it,

               <p n="3">3. If God by his antecedent will doth ſeriouſly and heartily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the ſalvation of all men, when ſome of theſe come to be damned, then this deſire either ſtill continues in him or not: If it doth not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, then his will is changeable, but he ſaith of himſelf, <hi>I am the Lord, I change not, Mal.</hi> 3.6. beſides they make this antecedent will wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he wills the ſalvation of all to flow from his nature; and being naturall to him, it muſt be unchangeable as his nature is: If it doth continue, then God continues earneſtly to deſire the ſalvation of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, when they are damned; ſo never hath his deſire accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, which cannot ſtand with perfect felicity: yea if it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, then God doth ſeriouſly will their ſalvation and damnation at one time, and ſo wills a flat contradiction: or elſe when he damns men, he doth not will to damn them; and ſo his actions are not gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his will.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If he doth will their Salvation, why doth he not work it, for he is in heaven, and doth whatſoever he will? he <hi>works all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the pleaſure of his will, Epheſ.</hi> 1.11.</p>

               <p n="1">1. In the examples of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> the Apoſtle excludeth not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:120043:20"/>only good works, but evill works, and both theſe upon the ſame ground, that both ſhewing mercy, and hardning might be referred to Gods free will and pleaſure, as to their firſt originall: And how ever theſe two, when they were in their mothers womb, were ſtained with originall ſin; yet here they are brought in by the Apoſtle in the ſame manner that <hi>Melchiſedec, Heb.</hi> 7. is brought in, without father or mother, though he had both father and mother, yet there he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as being without them: ſo here <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> are conſidered as having done neither good nor evill; when the divine Oracle was pronounced of loving the one, and hating the other: yea the Apoſtle ſpeaks of theſe as things which began not then, but long time before, it being ſaid <hi>Iacob</hi> have I loved, and <hi>Eſau</hi> have I hated.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conditions can no more agree with Gods decree of reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then of Election; becauſe neceſſary conditions have the nature of cauſes and means of preparation, and ſo cannot ſtand with the decree of God, which is abſolute, independent, and from all Eternity; and therfore can have nothing go before it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God cannot foreſee the fall as a thing that certainly ſhall be, till he hath decreed to permit it: now as the foreſight of the fall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth a decree of permitting this fall; ſo alſo this decree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion muſt preſuppoſe ſome end for which the Lord would permit it: and what can this be but the manifeſtation of his greateſt glory in the free ſalvation of ſome, and juſt damnation of others? ſo that in order of nature, the purpoſe of this muſt go before the purpoſe of permitting the fall, or the foreſight of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The foreſight of mans fall, preſuppoſeth the decree of mans creation: if therfore the foreſight of the fall goes before the decree of Election and reprobation; either God ſhould decree to make man to no end, or to ſome other end then he at laſt comes to, and ſo ſhould fail of his end.</p>

No man builds a houſe for the houſe ſake, but for his owne ſake.

               <p n="2">2. The conſervation of the creature, (which is a continued crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) hath the ſame end with creation; but how can this be ſaid to be done, to the praiſe of his abundant goodneſſe to ſome creatures?

               <p n="3">3. If the manifeſtation of his power and goodneſſe, be the laſt end of creation, then God hath attained his laſt end, ſo ſoon as ever man was created; for then he had ſhewed forth his abundant pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and goodneſſe: and then God had ſhewed the ſame goodneſſe both in the elect and reprobate, both equally partaking of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of Creation.</p>

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y of the ſecond cauſe, as appears.</p>
               <p n="1">1. No man can deny that the death of Chriſt was decreed of God, for Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, that <hi>he was delivered to death, by the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate counſell of God,</hi> Act. 2.23. yet Chriſt dyed freely for he ſaith of himſelfe, that he <hi>layd downe his life,</hi> yea, he laid it down freely, when no man had power to take it from him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.17, 18. beſides, if Chriſts death were not voluntary, it could not be meritorious, not being an act of obedience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our faith, repentance, obedience, and ſuch good works, as by grace we are enabled to performe, are voluntary actions, ſuch as we
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:120043:22"/>are not carried unto, either by any natural or violent neceſſity; yet theſe are decreed of God, who hath elected us unto faith and ſanctification, as well as unto life, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. as before hath been ſhewed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All our naturall actions and motions are voluntary, yet to deny that theſe are decreed of God, were to deny a ſpeciall part of his providence; for in him, we not onely live, but moove. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.28. God directeth mans ſteps, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.9. and look what he doth in time, he hath determined to do before all time.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Mans dayes are determined, and God hath appointed his bounds, that he cannot paſſe; yet many men come to their ends, by as contingent means as may be: as by the iron of the Axe, ſlipping from the helve, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.8. and many other the like.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Gods decree is, <hi>actio ad intra,</hi> an action within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: one of thoſe immanent actions of which the rule is, that they do <hi>nihil ponere in objecte,</hi> they put nothing at all into the object, about which they are converſant. Gods decree alone, (being an act within himſelfe) works nothing upon the creature, till it comes to execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till in ſome degree or other, he doth put forth his purpoſe by ſome outward action. Unleſſe therefore it can be ſhewed how God in the execution of the decree, by ſome outward action upon man, doth neceſſitate mans will, his decree alone will never inforce any neceſſity upon it, or on the actions which proceed from it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The decree of God, is ſo farre from taking away the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the ſecond cauſes, as it ſtabliſheth and ſtrengthneth them in their liberty: for he determineth not only <hi>rem ipſam, ſed modum rei,</hi> not only the thing or event it ſelfe, but the manner of it; he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth that ſome things ſhall come to paſſe neceſſarily, ſome things freely; and that neceſſary things ſhall be effected by neceſſary cauſes, contingent things, by contingent cauſes: All entityes and beings, are from God, with all the adjuncts and properties that belong to them; and he worketh in all things, according to the nature of the things: and therefore in naturall agents, he cauſeth things to come to paſſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily; in contingent and free agents, he cauſeth them to come to paſſe contingently: ſo that though Gods will determineth mans will, yet it derermineth it to work deliberately and freely, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its owne nature; therefore his will doth no way weaken, but ſtrengthen mans will in a free manner of working.</p>

                  </label> Yes, it is poſſible, as this effect hath reference to divers cauſes: for the not breaking of Chriſts bones, as it hath reference to the firſt cauſe, namely, the decree of God, was neceſſary, (as hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) but it was not neceſſary, but contingent, as it had reference to the ſecond cauſe, namely, the free will of the ſouldiers. So on the other ſide, the ſuns giving light in the ayre, and fire burning of combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible matter, are neceſſary effects as they have reference to the ſecond cauſes; but contingent, as they have reference to the firſt cauſe: for God doth freely, not neceſſarily concurre with the Sun in his ſhining, and the fire in his burning. Hence ariſeth that diſtinction of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo frequent with divines; namely, an abſolute or conditionall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; a neceſſity of the cauſe, or a neceſſity of conſequence: the neceſſity of the cauſe, or a neceſſity, is that whereby the ſecond cauſes are ſo faſt, firmely, and neceſſarily linked together, as according to the courſe of nature, the effect cannot come to paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then it doth; as the fire cannot but burne, fit fewell being put to it: but the neceſſity of conſequence is, when there is no ſuch
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:120043:23"/>faſt linking together of the ſecond cauſes: but that when they work one way, there is a power and diſpoſition in them to work another way: and thus there was a power in the ſouldiers to have broken Chriſts legs, when they let them alone; yet upon ſuppoſition of the divine decree, which cannot be fruſtrated, it is neceſſary that ſuch or ſuch things ſhould be effected as God hath determined. But as the power of God, whereby he is able to change the nature of the thing, doth not take away the neceſſity, which it receiveth from the ſecond cauſes; ſo likewiſe the will of God, whereby he hath determined the event one way, doth not take away the contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, which it receiveth from the ſecond cauſes, nor their liberty in working. But to ſpeak properly, effects have the denomination of neceſſity and contingency, not as they have reference to the firſt cauſe, but to the ſecond: for in regard of God, all things that come to paſſe, may be ſaid to be both neceſſary and contingent: neceſſary upon ſuppoſition of his decree, contingent as his decree was an act of his will, and therfore free. The creation of the world upon ſuppoſition of Gods decree, muſt needs be effected: but both the creation it ſelfe, as alſo the decree of the creation, are no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary but free acts, ariſing from the liberty of will, not neceſſity of nature.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The praeſcience of God (upon the former ground) doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre a neceſſity as well as his decree; for as it is not poſſible that Gods will ſhould be fruſtrated, ſo neither that his praeſcience ſhould be deceived; therefore the thing muſt neceſſarily come to paſſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods fore-knowledge of it, elſe he might be deceived in his knowledge; and ſo his knowledge were not a true knowledge. <hi>Arminians</hi> therefore muſt either hold that God had no certain fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of mans fall, or elſe that he fell neceſſarily by this kinde of neceſſity, namely, the neceſſity of ſuppoſition or of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: and ſo their argument drawne from neceſſity, againſt the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of mans will, will have as much force againſt themſelves, as againſt their adverſaries.

As on the other ſide, God doth ſave none but ſuch as live holily, and obey his Commands; and doth decree to ſave onely ſuch as theſe: yet though holines and obedience go before ſalvation, they do not go before Election, which is Gods purpoſe and decree of ſalvation; ſo it is here, though ſin goes before the execution yet not before the decree that was from all Eternity.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:120043:26"/>
               <p>That the foreſight of ſinne is not the cauſe of reprobation is thus proved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. No temporall thing can be the cauſe of that which is Eternall, but ſin is a temporall thing, (there being no ſin before the world was) and the decree of God is Eternall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The foreſight of ſin is no more efficacious to move God to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point ſome to be veſſels of wrath, then the foreſight of good works is to move him to appoint others to be veſſels of mercy, (God being in his own nature no leſſe prone to ſhew forth mercy by beſtowing reward, then to ſhew his juſtice by puniſhing) but the foreſight of good works is not the cauſe of Election.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How can the foreſight of ſin be the cauſe of reprobation, when as the foreſight preſuppoſeth a decree of permitting ſin? (for as ſinne cannot be unleſſe God permits it to be, ſo he cannot foreſee it ſhall be, unleſſe he had decreed this permiſſion) this decree to permit ſin preſuppoſeth an end for which God permits it, (which can be no other then the glorifying of his juſtice in the juſt condemnation of ſome men) and that being the end, muſt needs in order of nature go before the means that tend to it: therefore the decree of reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt needs go before the decree of permitting ſin to be, without which there can be no foreſight of it; beſides, what is firſt in Gods intention (if we ſpeak of the laſt ends) muſt be laſt in execution: therefore if the decree of permiting ſin ſhall go before Gods decree of glorifying himſelf in the juſt condemnation of ſome men for ſin, then this ſhould be laſt in execution; and ſo God ſhould firſt bring condemnation upon men for ſin, and afterwards permit them to ſin; which is ſo abſurd as all will readily reject it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The doctrine, which makes the foreſight of the fall, yea of all actuall ſins to go before the decree of reprobation will not clear God from all appearance of cruelty and hard dealing with man, no more then the doctrine of the abſolute decree: for if God did certainely foreſee that having created man, and placed him in ſuch or ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that being left to himſelf without a new ſupply of effectuall grace, he would certainly fall and commit ſuch ſins as would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring upon him eternall damnation and deſtruction; if he did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee that his Sonne being offered to him, he would certainly reject and refuſe him, and perſiſt in doing ſo to the end, why did he not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this? why did he not keep men from falling at all, or not raiſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:120043:26"/>them up when they were fallen by beſtowing ſuch effectuall grace upon them whereby they ſhould have layd hold of Chriſt, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in doing this to the end? ſince God could have done this, yea have done it without any wrong to his juſtice, as well for all, as for ſome; if he bears ſuch love to all, as he earneſtly, heartily, and inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires they ſhould be ſaved; why doth he not procure their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince he is able to do it? if he be ſo tender hearted that he cannot endure their deſtruction, why doth he not keep them from it, ſince he is able to do it?</p>

                  </label> The will of God in Scripture is taken two wayes, either properly, or improperly: either for the will of his decree, or the will of his command: that there is a reall difference betwixt theſe, appears by theſe reaſons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The will of his command may be reſiſted, the will of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap>decree cannot be reſiſted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The will of his command is mutable (as were all the commands about the ceremoniall law) the will of his decree is immutable.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His commands are given forth in time, whereas his decrees are from all eternity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. His commands may be contrary one to the other (as he gave command to <hi>Abraham</hi> firſt to kill, then not to kill his ſon) whereas his decrees are never contrary one to another.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The will of his command is an effect that ariſeth from him, it is ſomthing that he puts forth out of himſelfe, but the will of his decree
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:120043:27"/>is the ſame with himſelf; for take <hi>will</hi> properly, and then <hi>velle, agere,</hi> and <hi>eſſe,</hi> are all one in God.</p>
               <p>To apply this to the preſent purpoſe; the will of God in theſe and the like places is not to be underſtood of the will of his decree, but of the will of his command; he may be ſaid not to will, deſire, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the death of a ſinner, becauſe he commands and injoyns every man to do that which would keep him from death, and certainly bring him to life, were it obſerved, oftimes, though not alwayes, (as in the example of <hi>Abrahams</hi> killing his ſon) the will of his command is an effect of his internall will; and therefore by a metonimy is called by the ſame name.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Somtimes will and affections are attributed to God in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>per modum actionis,</hi> in regard of his actions, as he is ſaid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, not becauſe he changeth his mind, but becauſe he changeth his actions, as a repenting man is wont to do: ſo he is ſaid to will or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſuch or ſuch a thing, becauſe he ſo carries himſelf in his actions as one that deſires a thing ſhould be; his actions are ſuch as are fit to bring forth ſuch an effect.</p>
               <p>Thus likewiſe he may be ſayd not to will the death of a ſinner, or the death of him that dies, becauſe his carriage towards them, and all his actions and dealings with them are ſuch as are fit to preſerve them from death and deſtruction, and to bring them to life and ſafety; his goodnes, forbearance, and long ſuffering lead to repentance; his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are upon the Earth that the Inhabitants of the World might learn Righteouſnes, much more do his Word and Ordinances imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly tend to life.</p>
               <p>That in this and the like places the will of God is not to be taken properly, for the will of his decree or good pleaſure, appears; becauſe this is alway fulfilled, what he wills he works: Our <hi>God is in heaven, and doth whatſoever he will,</hi> Pſalm. 115.3. <hi>whatſoever pleaſed the Lord that did hee in heaven and in earth, Pſalm.</hi> 135.6. where will (properly taken) and power concurre, there effect muſt needs follow, and ſo no ſinner ſhould die. When the Scripture mentions two things of God which cannot ſtand together, as that he doth repent, and that he cannot repent, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.11.29. <hi>that he wills not the death of a ſinner, Ezek.</hi> 33.11. <hi>and that the Lord hardens whom he will, Rom.</hi> 9.18. we are to look which of theſe agrees with the nature of God, and this is to be taken properly; the other figuratively: now it well agrees
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:120043:27"/>with the nature of God to effect his own end and purpoſe; when therefore it is ſaid, that he doth not will or deſire the death of him that dies, this is not to be taken properly, but figuratively; becauſe to will and not to will cannot both agree to God being taken in the ſame ſenſe; for no man dies, but God inflicts this death upon him, and he cannot be ſaid to do this either beſides or againſt his will.</p>

               <p>IN the Article of Redemption, theſe two things principally are queſtioned:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether the proper effect of Chriſts death and paſſion be mans redemption, as pardon of ſin, reconciliation with God, &amp;c. ſo that Chriſt died to purchaſe theſe things actually for thoſe for whom he died; or only to purchaſe a poſſibility or liberty for God to ſave ſinfull man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether Chriſt by his death hath purchaſed, or obtained theſe things for every particular man or not, or there be ſome for whom Chriſt hath not died in this ſenſe.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:120043:28"/>
               <p>For the firſt, it is denyed by the <hi>Arminians,</hi> who affirme that actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all redemption, remiſſion of ſinne, juſtification of ſuch or ſuch men,
<note place="margin">Immediata mortis Chriſti effectio non eſt actualis peccao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum remiſſio, horum aut illo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum redemptio, ſed redemptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis apud Deum impetratio, qua factum eſt, ut Deusiam poſſit, utpote iuſtitia, cui ſatisfactum eſt, non obſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, homnibus peccatoribus peccata remitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re et ſpititum ſanctum largiri. Armin. in Perk. pag. 75.76.</note> was not the proper and immediate effect of Chriſts death, but only ſuch an obtaining of redemption at the hands of God, whereby he may notwithſtanding his juſtice (which is now ſatisfyed) beſtow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinne and the ſpirit of grace upon ſinfull men: by which it appeares, that they would have the effect of Chriſts death to be, not the actuall redemption of any man, but onely the purchaſe of a liberty or poſſibility for God to redeeme and ſave whom he pleaſed; but how unſound this is, may appeare by theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hence it follows, that the eternall damnation of all mankinde may ſtand with the death of Chriſt, and that though Chriſt hath dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for mans ſalvation, yet it may ſo fall out, as no man ſhall be ſaved; for he hath purchaſed not an actuall, but only a poſsible redemption, and it is not neceſſary, that a thing onely poſsible ſhould ever come to be effected; beſides, as ſome reject Chriſt, ſo may all men do not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this poſsible redemption, and ſo none be ſaved: which how injurious it is to the infinite merit and excellency of Chriſts death all may eaſily ſee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence it follows, that Chriſt hath no more redeemed man in one kinde, then God himſelfe in another: for as he hath redeemed man no otherway, then that by the vertue of his death, he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured that they may be redeemed; ſo in like manner, thus farre he may be ſaid to have redeemed God himſelfe, becauſe by the vertue of his death, he hath procured that God may redeem them: which is wholy contrary to the phraſe of Scripture, which every where tels us that we are redeemed not with corruptible things, but with the precious bloud of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. that while we were enemies Chriſt dyed for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. that he was wounded for our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and broken for our tranſgreſsions, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53.4. but ſaith no where that God was redeemed, or that Chriſt dyed for him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the immediate and proper eſſect of Chriſts death was only a poſsible redemption or reconciliation, then Chriſt did by his death very little advance and ſet forward the work of mans redemption and ſalvation, becauſe he effected no more then what might have been done without it: for before Chriſt dyed, it was poſsible for God to redeem man, to grant him pardon of ſin, and other like bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, by what meanes himſelfe ſhould thinke fit, and amongſt the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:120043:29"/>reſt, by this means, namely, the death of his ſon: ſo that if no more be effected afterwards by the death of Chriſt, then only a poſsibility to do this, then this moſt glorious work ſhould vaniſh away almoſt into nothing; there being nothing more done by it, then was done before, namely, a poſsibility procured to do that which before was poſsible to be done; and thus God can be ſaid no more to pardon mens ſins for Chriſts ſake, then to make many worlds for his owne ſake, for he hath power and liberty to do this when he will.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Then Chriſts merits ſhould be of leſſe value and worth then mans merits, for when man meriteth any thing for himſelfe, he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riteth that the thing ſhould be actually beſtowed on him, and not that there ſhould be a poſſibility only for it to be beſtowed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Hence it would follow, that neither God nor man were the immediate objects of Chriſts merits, but rather faith and repentance, that honour might be done to thoſe graces above others, in that they be made the conditions, whereto not only ſalvation, but alſo redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, election, and all ſhould be faſtned.</p>

               <p n="1">1. If he hath obtained onely a poſsible and ineffectuall redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, this hath been overthrown by the former arguments.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if the redemption purchaſed be an ineffectuall redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how comes it to be made effectuall? if it ſhall be ſaid by appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and then it becomes effectuall when it is applyed; againſt this it may further be replyed, how can we apply that which is not? we can apply no other redemption then what Chriſt hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: if therefore he hath purchaſed only an ineffectuall redemption, for our application doth not change the nature of the thing, or make it other then it was.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How can we be effectualy redeemed, by applying to our ſelves an ineffectuall redemption? how can the partaking of an ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all redemption, effectually bring ſalvation to us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If Chriſt hath obtained actuall redemption for all, then likewiſe he hath obtained actuall remiſsion of ſinnes for all, (for remiſsion of ſinnes, juſtification, reconciliation, redemption, are all one, not onely in Scripture phraſe, but alſo by <hi>Arminius</hi> his own acknowledgement <hi>pag.</hi> 76. in <hi>Perk.</hi>) if he hath obtained remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes for all, why are not their ſinnes remitted?

How can Chriſt be ſaid to obtain thoſe benefits for us, which we have no benefit by; or that good for us, which we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the better for? the nature of the action, and right of relation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, that thoſe things be made ours, and that we have the benefit of them, which Chriſt hath obtained for us: For what ever Chriſt by his death hath purchaſed for us, that we have a right unto; and that cannot juſtly be withheld from us: which may thus be proved in a right forme of argument. Their ſinnes ſhall not be required of them, for whom perfect ſatisfaction is made: But for whom Chriſt hath dyed, he hath made perfect ſatisfaction, <hi>ergo,</hi> their ſins ſhall not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them, for whom Chriſt hath dyed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond propoſition is clear, the firſt is thus proved.</p>
               <p>Their ſinnes ſhall not be required of them, for whom ſatisfaction is accepted.</p>
               <p>But for whom perfect ſatisfaction is made, divivine juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it ſhould be accepted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> their ſins ſhall not be required of them.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:120043:30"/>
               <p>The ſecond propoſition cannot be denyed, the firſt is thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>The debt cannot juſtly be required of them, for whom it is fully paid.</p>
               <p>But for whom perfect ſatisfaction is both made and accepted, the debt is fully paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> the debt of ſin ſhall not be required of them; or thus.</p>
               <p>For whoſe ſins Chriſt hath ſatisfyed, they cannot be puniſhed (and that everlaſtingly) for their ſins, without injuſtice: But reprobates ſuffer everlaſting puniſhment for their ſins, without injuſtice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Chriſt hath not dyed or ſatisfied for their ſins.</p>
               <p>To which of theſe arguments or parts of them, will that diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of impetration and application be fitly applied, to take away the ſtrength and force of them? God cannot in juſtice require a double payment of the ſame debt, and cauſe ſo many men to pay the utmoſt farthing in their owne perſons, by ſuffering eternally in the place of torment, when Chriſt hath already paid their debt, and made full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, by ſuffering for them on the Croſſe; for whether Chriſt hath merited forgiveneſſe of ſinnes for us, by the dignity of the worke and worthineſſe of his death and paſsion, or by the conſtitution and appointment of God the father, it is certaine that God cannot in juſtice withhold from us, that which Chriſt by his death hath purchaſed for us: Beſides all thoſe for whom Chriſt hath dyed, ſhall receive the adoption of ſons, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. but all do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the adoption of ſons: <hi>ergo,</hi> Chriſt hath not paid the price of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption for all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Application ariſeth from impetration, as a neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent or effect of it; therefore for whom ever Chriſt hath obtained redemption, the benefit of redemption ſhall in due time be applied unto them; not only becauſe forgiveneſſe of ſin is due where ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made, but alſo becauſe the death of Chriſt is meritorious as well as ſatisfactory: Chriſt by his death and obedience, hath meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſalvation, with all that belongs to it; he hath merited both grace and glory for thoſe for whom he died: and among other graces, he hath merited faith, repentance, and what elſe is needfulll for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Chriſt.</p>

It is ſaid, that <hi>our old man was crucified together with him, that the body of ſinne might be deſtroyed,</hi> Rom. 6.6. <hi>that he hath redeemed us from all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> Tit. 2.14. <hi>that he hath delivered us from the hands or power of all our enemies,</hi> Luke 1.75. not onely Sathan and the world are our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but moſt of all, our ſinnes; and principally thoſe things which moſt hinder us from partaking of the benefit of redemption; as our naturall infidelity, rebellion of will, hardneſſe of heart and the like: It cannot ſtand with the nature and worke of a perfect redeemer, to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:120043:31"/>deliver us from ſome enemies, to free us from ſome ſinnes, and leave us to quit our ſelves from the reſt; therefore theſe things are among the number of thoſe things Chriſt came to deliver us from, being parts of that old man, and that body of ſinne which he came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy; and we being delivered from the power of theſe, and the ſtrength of theſe, as all other ſinnes being deſtroyed in us, they ſhall not hinder us from receiving the benefits of redemption, when they are offered to us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though the proferre of Salvation be conditionall, yet the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of it is not conditionall, but abſolute: for Chriſt hath abſolutely purchaſed ſalvation for his ſheep, for whom he hath laid downe his life; <hi>unto theſe he will give eternall life,</hi> Joh. 10.27. This ſalvation ſhall be beſtowed on them, when they beleeve and repent; therefore it is offered to them upon the conditions of faith and repentance, but both ſalvation it ſelfe, as alſo faith and repentance were abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely purchaſed for them; and therefore in due time they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

Is not here a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of ſanctification, with the graces belonging to it, without any condition?</p>

Suppoſe that we ſhould conceive of ſome worke of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and pravious diſpoſition, upon condition whereof, promiſe is made of giving faith and repentance, and yet he hath purchaſed theſe conditions likewiſe, or any other thing that may go before theſe, and ſo if we ſhall go <hi>in infinitum;</hi> for through him are given us all things pertaining to life and godlineſſe.</p>

               <p>Chriſt is ſo skilfull and carefull a Phiſitian, as he hath not onely provided a ſoveraigne medicine for us, but alſo applies it unto us, (if we be his) elſe he ſhould provide it to no purpoſe; we being not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extreame ſicke and weak, but alſo dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5. and therefore as unable to apply it to our ſelves, as a dead man to take a potion, that is ready tempered for him, untill Chriſt quickens us, by putting his ſpirit into us: the Apoſtle ſaith, that we <hi>are quickned in and by Chriſt, and that we are ſaved by grace,</hi> Eph. 2.5.8. this muſt needs be ſuch a grace as Chriſt hath purchaſed for us, but the purchaſe of this grace onely, will neither quicken nor ſave us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be applyed and given to us: therefore for whom he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed grace, to them he applyes it.</p>

               <p>IN the article of Converſion, the queſtion is not whether it be the worke of grace or not; for <hi>Arminians</hi> themſelves grant, (at leaſt in word) that the beginnings, progreſſe and perfection of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is from grace; but the thing principally queſtioned is, the manner of the operation of this grace, whether it is <hi>per modum ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionis vel per phiſicam operationem,</hi> onely by outward perſwaſion, or by ſuch an inward ſupernaturall and effectuall operation, as ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take effect: whether by ſuch a grace as is reſiſtable or irreſiſtable.

Hag. p. 122.</note> namely, that God works mans converſion onely by morall ſwaſion, and by ſuch a grace as it is in mans power to reſiſt, yea, ſo to reſiſt, as to make the effect of it whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly void. All the operations being granted, which God is wont to uſe in converting men, yet converſion it ſelfe ſo remaineth in mans power, as he may be converted or not converted (ſaith <hi>Arnoldus.</hi>) On the other ſide, we hold that in mans converſion, God doth not only uſe outward perſwaſion, but ſuch an inward and effectuall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as cauſeth a change in mans minde and will; making him both able and willing to do what God cals him to: and works by ſuch a grace, which though a man may, and for a time doth reſiſt, yet he ſhall not, nor cannot reſiſt ſo as to overcome it, and wholy hinder the worke of his owne converſion when God intends it: So that the ſumme of the difference is this. <hi>Arminians</hi> hold that God gives to man ſuch a grace, whereby he may be converted of he will; we
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:120043:37"/>hold that he gives ſuch a grace, whereby he ſhall certainly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; ſuch a grace whereby he receives not onely power, but alſo will for his owne converſion: that this is agreeable to truth, appears by theſe reaſons following.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Argument. </seg>1</label> What God hath promiſed to his people that he performs, that he gives; but he hath promiſed not onely to give power to repent and beleeve, but alſo to give will, yea, to give the act it ſelfe: the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>it is he that works in us both to will and to do,</hi> Phil. 2.13. and he uſeth this as an argument; why we ſhould worke out our owne ſalvation, which were of no force if God did not firſt move our wils, before we begin to worke; ſo he ſaith, that <hi>it is given to us through Chriſt to beleeve on him:</hi> Phil. 1.29. therefore he gives more then power, he gives the will, yea, the act it ſelfe of beleeving. So the Lord promiſeth this unto his people, as a principall grace belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the new Covenant, namely that he would <hi>put his law into their inward parts, and write it in their hearts,</hi> Jer. 31.33. <hi>and cauſe them to walke in his ſtatutes and keep his judgements, Ezek.</hi> 36.27. what is this putting his law into their inward parts, but putting it into their mindes, by cauſing them to know it (as he promiſeth them that he will teach them his ſtatutes) and putting it into their wils, by cauſing them to love and like it, yea, by making this knowledge and love of his law to ſtick faſt, to remain and abide with them, for he <hi>will write it in their hearts:</hi> yea, more then ſo, <hi>he will</hi> bring it into their actions, for <hi>he will cauſe them to walk in his ſtatutes and keep his Commands:</hi> Here is more then a generall power, whereby they ſhall beleeve and obey if they will: if not, they may let all alone, but a ſpeciall grace wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſhall both will and doe the thing which God requires.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The work of faith is not ſaid to be a worke of perſwaſion, but of power. Hence it is called the <hi>faith of the operation of God,</hi> Col. 2.12. and <hi>the worke of faith with power,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.11. yea of a mighty power: the Apoſtle prayes for the Epheſians, that God would <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the eyes of their underſtanding, that they might know what was the hope of their calling,
<note place="margin">Non utitur om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotens et irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtibili motio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ad fidem in nobis ingene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randam. Arm. in Perk. pag. 223.</note> and what is the exceeding greatneſſe of his power in thoſe that beleeve, according to the working of his mighty power,</hi> Epheſ. 1.18.19. even ſuch <hi>a power as wrought in Chriſt, when he was raiſed from the dead.</hi> v. 20. col. 2.20. this mighty power is more then a morall ſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and here we may take notice that <hi>Arminius</hi> even in direct terms contradicts the Apoſtle when he tels us that God doth not worke
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:120043:38"/>by any omnipotent and irreſiſtable motion in begetting faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We are ſaid not onely to be ſicke, but <hi>dead, in ſinnes and treſpaſſes,</hi> Epheſ. 2.1. <hi>the dead ſhall he are the voice of the ſonne of God,</hi> Joh. 5.25. <hi>this my ſonne that was dead is now alive. Luke</hi> 15.24 there is more then perſwaſion, yea, no leſſe then an almighty power needfull for the quickning of dead men, and as dead men want power to quicken and raiſe up themſelves; neither can they hinder their quickning and raiſing up, when God is pleaſed to worke it: no more can dead ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners raiſe or quicken their owne ſoules, or hinder this worke when God comes to doe it: to this purpoſe alſo this worke of converſion or regeneration, is compared to a new reſurrection or creation: if ye <hi>be riſen againe with Chriſt,</hi> Col. 3.1. <hi>create in me a new heart,</hi> Pſal. 51.10. and the Lord promiſeth his people, that he would <hi>give them a new heart and a new ſpirit, and that he would take out of them the heart of ſtone, and put into them a heart of fleſh.</hi> Ezek. 36.26. this new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reſurrection, this changing of the heart of ſtone into a heart of fleſh, requires not ſo much perſwaſion as power, ſuch a power as makes a man not onely able, but willing; as changeth the whole frame of his heart, and makes him of unwilling to become willing; of ſtone to become fleſh: nothing but an omnipotent power can change ſtone into fleſh.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Scripture makes that grace, whereby God converts and draws a ſinner to himſelfe to be ſuch a grace as alwayes hath a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine effect, and is not left to the liberty of mans will, to fruſtrate and make void if he will: <hi>turne thou me and I ſhall be turned</hi> (ſay the people of God) <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18. not turne thou me, and then I may turne if I will, but turne thou me, beſtow on me the grace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and then I ſhall certainly be turned: <hi>draw me, we will run af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Apoſtle ſaith, it is <hi>not in him that willeth, or him that runneth, but in God that ſheweth mercy,</hi> Rom. 9.16. If God beſtows onely a generall or ſufficient grace, whereby a man may beleeve and repent if

                  </gap> if he ſeeth him to uſe it well, then to concurre with him, and to cauſe the act of believing alſo: if otherwiſe, then to withhold: then it is in him that willeth and runneth, which contradicts the Apoſtle; for as God ſees man to will, ſo he is ready to worke: If it be ſaid it is not in him that will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and runneth, becauſe it is not the worke of mans will alone, without Gods ſhewing mercy, then the Apoſtle might as well have ſaid, it is not of God that ſheweth mercy, but of him that willeth, &amp;c. becauſe Gods grace works not converſion alone without the concurrence of mans free-will, yea, (according to <hi>Arminians</hi>) is led by it: for as man wills, ſo God workes; if mans will moveth, then God joynes his worke; if man be unwilling, then Gods worke is ſtopped.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If all the imaginations of mans heart be onely evill, and that continually, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. if that light that is in him be darkeneſſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8. If the naturall man doth not, nor cannot underſtand the things of God, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. if he hath not ſufficiency of himſelfe to thinke any good, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.3. if the wiſedome of the fleſh be enmity with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. if the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God ſeems fooliſhneſſe to it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. then there needs more then gentle perſwading to take away this blindneſſe and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, this impotency and weakneſſe, this enmity and oppoſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and the worke of his grace; then it is vaine to ſay that God ſtands ready to concurre with man, when he ſees him moving his owne will to what is good, when he knowes that he hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will nor power for any good, till himſelfe hath put it into him by the grace of true converſion.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If God gives only power to men to repent and believe if they will, and leaves the acting of theſe things to the liberty of their owne wills; diſpenſing his co-operating grace (as they call it) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he ſees the will of man carrying it ſelfe in receiving or not receiving the preventing grace, then man ſeparates himſelfe (when he is converted) and makes himſelfe to differ from another man, contrary to that of the Apoſtle, who hath made thee to differ from another? and what haſt thou, that thou haſt not received? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7. yes, may ſome man ſay, I have ſomething which I have not received, namely, the right motion of mine owne will, in not
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:120043:39"/>reſiſting grace offered; for according to this doctrine, when two men have the ſame power inwardly, and the ſame means outwardly, grace being offered to both, at the ſame time, by the ſame perſon, and in the ſame manner; the reaſon why one receives, and the other doth not; that one repents and beleeves, and the other doth not, is becauſe the one wills, and the other wills not; the one uſeth his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty well, the other ill: it being equally in the power of both to receive grace offered, or to refuſe it; and ſo by this reaſon, not God but man ſhould ſeparate himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. According to this doctrine, man ſhould be the principall agent in the worke of converſion, and beare a better part therein then God and his grace; for act is more excellent then power, and it is better to will the doing of good, then onely to be able to doe it; God gives onely power, but man by putting forth his will, cauſeth this to come into act: mans will firſt moves, and this motion leads the way to Gods grace, to move and concurre in the act of converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo is made the more excellent worker.</p>
               <p n="9">9. From both theſe it follows, that man hath cauſe of glorying or boaſting in himſelfe, becauſe he hath ſeparated himſelfe, and his will hath borne the better part in the worke of converſion; contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>why doſt thou glory as if thou hadſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.7. <hi>of grace, not of workes, leſt any man ſhould boaſt,</hi> Eph. 2.8. may not a man juſtly glory in himſelfe, when the reaſon why he is converted and another is not, (both having the like means and helpe from God) is becauſe he uſed his liberty of willing well, when another uſed it ill: he applyed himſelfe to receive that which another rejected; the motion of his owne will hath (as it were) led the way to Gods will in the worke of converſion?</p>
               <p n="10">10 If Gods worke in converſion ſhould be onely by way of ſwaſion and propounding objects, then he and his grace ſhould be no more powerfull and efficacious in converting men, then the devill is in perverting and ſeducing, for he workes in propounding objects, and that in the moſt congruous time and manner that may bee; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that of the Apoſtle, greater <hi>is he that is in you, then he that is in the world,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.4. which he brings as an argument, to prove that they had and ſhould overcome temptations and ſeducings, becauſe the ſpirit of grace which was in them, was greater in regard of his powerfull manner of working, then he which was in the world,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:120043:39"/>that ſpirit of Antichriſt which went about to ſeduce and pervert men, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. yea, there ſhould be no difference betwixt God and the Miniſters, in the worke of converſion, for the kinde and manner of working, though there may be for the meaſure and degree: for the Miniſter workes by perſwading and propounding objects, and God workes no otherwiſe, though he may perſwade more ſtrongly: yea, upon this ground it differs not in meaſure and degree, becauſe in an ordinary courſe, God perſwades no man by his owne voice imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, but doth this by the mouths of his Meſſengers and Miniſters, who are Gods Embaſſadours, beſeeching men in Chriſts ſtead to be reconciled to Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. and he ſaves men by <hi>the fooliſhneſſe of preaching,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.21. Can it be fitly ſaid of the Miniſter, that he opens mens eyes or hearts, that he takes away the heart of ſtone, and gives a heart of fleſh; that he creates a new heart in men, that he writes Gods lawes in their hearts, and cauſeth them to walke in his ſtatutes? &amp;c. which might be both truly and fitly ſayd of him, if he did worke after the ſame manner that God doth.</p>
               <p n="11">11. If God workes mans converſion onely by way of ſwaſion, and by ſuch a grace as ofttimes is reſiſted and alwayes may be; then as one man doth reſiſt this grace, and make it ineffectuall, ſo may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother and another, yea, ſo may all men do: and ſo it is poſſible that all men may partake of the grace of converſion, and yet never a man in the world be converted: which is contrary to the excellency and efficacy of the grace of God, and to that of the Prophet, <hi>convert thou me and I ſhall be converted,</hi> Jer. 31.18. If nature doth nothing in vaine, much leſſe doth grace. How can faith be the gift of God, and thoſe never receive it to whom it is given? yea, the thing it ſelfe which is given, not have being at all <hi>in rerum natura.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. By this doctrine, that ſpeciall grace of converſion ſhould be for litle purpoſe, or rather be of no uſe at all; for if God ſtands ready, by his ſpeciall grace to concurre with man in the act of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and repenting, onely when he ſees man moving and applying his owne will to the doing of theſe things, what needs there any ſuch ſpeciall grace at all? for to will to repent and beleeve, is all one with repenting and beleeving: they teach that if man doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſift God calling him to beleeve, that God is ready to concurre with him in the act of beleeving: now not to reſiſt this call, is to obey it, to obey God calling to beleeve, what is it but to beleeve? If man
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:120043:40"/>doth believe what needs there any help of ſpeciall grace to cauſe him to do that which he doth already? or how can God be ſaid to work that which hath been wrought already, or give being to that which hath being already: nothing can be a condition of it ſelf, and it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to ſay that God is ready to work faith in us, and cauſe us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, if wee believe already, before he puts forth this Worke of his.</p>

               <p>IN the article of Perſeverance, the principall queſtion is, whether a true beleever, ſuch as by a living juſtifying faith is united to Chriſt, and made a true member of him, may fall away, that is ſo fall as he wholy loſeth his faith, ceaſeth to be a member of Chriſt, and ſo comes to periſh in the end: to this <hi>Arminians</hi> anſwer, that a true beleever is ſo upheld by Chriſt in all his temptations, that by no force or fraud of Satan or any outward enemy, he ſhall be taken out of Chriſts hand: but by his owne negligence and abuſe of his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, he may wholy make ſhipwracke of faith and a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, fall from grace, ceaſe to be a member of Chriſt &amp;c. becauſe all promiſes touching ſupport are conditionall, and the fullfilling of theſe promiſes, depends upon our performance of the condition, and doing the duty that God requires of us.</p>

If ſuch as are built on the rocke may fall away, and the ſheep of Chriſt may periſh; this would argue a defect not onely in mans free-will, but in the rocke it ſelfe; not onely in the ſheepe, but in the ſheepheard; for if he be both carefull and able to keep them, what ſhould hinder that they are not kept? If it be ſaid that their own wils hinder, becauſe they either neglect or reject their owne conſervation; this cannot be, for when Chriſt made them his ſheep, of unwilling, he made them willing to come to him, to heare his voice and follow him: when he takes them into his cuſtody, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them to be both willing and carefull to remaine and abide with him: If at any time they grow careleſſe and backward, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come croſſe and perverſe, he cauſeth them to ſee this and repent of it: otherwiſe how were he a faithfull ſheepheard, if he did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thoſe that are committed to his cuſtody, from all ſuch dangers and defections as will bring deſtruction, when he is able to doe it, and when he hath promiſed that they ſhall never periſh? <hi>John</hi> 10.2. how was Chriſt a perfect Saviour (as before was ſhewed) if he ſhould preſerve and deliver his ſheep, for whom he hath laid down his life, and whom he hath taken into his cuſtody, from ſome dangers
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:120043:48"/>and ſome enemies only, and not from all? if he ſhould deliver them from externall enemies only, and not from internall, from fathan and this evill World, but not from the power of that corruption that cleaves to their natures? from the old man and body of ſinne, from that law of their members which rebels againſt the law of their mind, and leads them captive to ſinne and death? from that fleſh which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alway luſts againſt the Spirit, as being alway contrary to it? eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince this of all other enemies is the moſt dangerous as being within us, and therefore neereſt to us; as being that without which all outward enemies could do us no harme; outward enticings not being able to prevaile if we were not drawne away and enticed by our own concupiſcence.</p>
                  <p>How can Chriſt bee ſaid to ſave us out of the hands of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and all that hate us, if hee doth ſtill leave us in the hand of our neareſt and worſt enemy? ſaving us onely from the power of Satan and wicked men; but leaving us to the power of ſinne and corruption, and to the ſway of our owne evill hearts, which are deſperately wicked and deceitfull above all things, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. and which will certainly lead us to deſtruction, if we be left to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill bent and inclination of them; To conclude, how can the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full be ſaid to have <hi>ſtrong conſolations? Heb.</hi> 6.9. either from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, or merits and mediation of Chriſt, if the utmoſt extent of theſe, be to give them aſſurance that they ſhall bee kept free onely from force and violence; ſo as they ſhall never be drawne from Chriſt againſt their wills, and made to fall away whether they will or no: but otherwiſe, if at any time their wills faile, then ſhall Chriſts helpe be ready to faile; and hee will no longer undertake the keeping of them, then he ſees them carefull to keep themſelves? Is it not Chriſts keeping that makes them watchfull and careful to keep themſelves? Is it not his care and good will that makes them both willing and able to reſiſt temptation, and to do all things needfull for their owne ſafety and preſervation? certainly if it were not, they could take ſmall comfort in all the promiſes that are made to them.</p>
